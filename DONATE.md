## Donate

#### Thanks!
If you're reading this after click the PayPal Donate Button, i'm really glad for your help in this project! Yupi is open-source, and under <b>MIT License</b>
Anyone can edit, download, do a copy, change credits, do whathever. Moreover, this is the official repository of the emulator.
Me [Claudio Santoro](https://github.com/sant0ro) doesn't receive any budget, money or callback for this work. Also i never asked money before for anyone.
I'm not asking, but i'm glad if you contributed. Any value is great. The Donators Names will appear on this Repository and in a special Thanks in the Emulator Initialize.
Also maybe some special Bots will be made. Again, thanks for the support. Making this project is really hard.

### You didn't donated?
If you didn't donated but seeing this page, no problem! If you want to donate go back in README, and see the donate button.
Thanks!
